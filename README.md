# PAKT

## Introduction 
I'm creating this app to help streamline the process of packing for an outdoor adventure. 
I enjoy spending my spare time outdoors cycling, hiking, skiing and surfing. I find that packing the right gear and food for these adventures becomes a time consuming process. 
There's some key factors that need to be considered when packing for an outdoor adventure: temperature & weather, trip duration (day trip, overnight, multi day) and activity (cycling, hiking, skiing etc).

## Aim
To create an app that considers the temperature & weather, trip duration and activity of a user's future adventure and using a series of filters, outputs a gear list that's suited to these conditions.

There will be two sections to this app, Gear Management and Packing. 
The user will catalogue their favourite activities and gear in Gear Management. Then in Packing they will input the details of an upcoming trip and receive a filtered gear list.


## Stack
- PostGreSQL
- Express.js
- React
- Node.js

## Future Improvements
- Create Gear Management section.
- Map gear lists created in Gear Management into Packing section.
- Implement weather API.
- Improve food calculations based on user's nutritional needs.
- Implement Auth0.
- Create Dashboard / Homepage.
- Update styling to new look and feel.
