# PAKT

## Introduction 
I'm creating this app to help streamline the process of packing for an outdoor adventure. 
I spend a lot of time outdoors enjoying cycling, hiking, skiing and surfing. I find that packing the right gear and food for these adventures often becomes a time consuming process. 
There's some key factors that need to be considered when packing for an outdoor adventure: temperature & weather, trip duration (day trip, overnight, multi day) and activity (cycling, hiking, skiing etc).

## Aim
To create an app that considers the temperature & weather, trip duration and activity of a user's future adventure and using a series of filters, outputs a gear list that's suited to the conditions.

There will be two sections to this app, Gear Management and Packing. 
The user will catalogue their favourite activities and gear in Gear Management. Then in Packing they will input the details of an upcoming trip and receive a filtered gear list.
